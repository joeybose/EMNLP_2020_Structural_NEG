\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we introduced SANS a novel negative sampling strategy which directly leverages information about local neighborhood structures to select negative examples. We find that negative samples chosen simply based on the graph structure in KG's have comparable performance with SOTA approaches and even outperform previous sophisticated GAN-based approaches. Our work sheds light on the need and importance of incorporating graph structure when designing future negative samplers for KG's and SANS can be seen as a powerful baseline that requires no additional parameters or difficult optimization.

Respectfully, it would be worthwhile to extend the idea of structural negative sampling in various ways for efficient and effective training of graph embedding models. A potential improvement could be training graph embedding models with positive and negative context graphs \cite{navarin2018pre} in addition to positive and negative triplets.}
